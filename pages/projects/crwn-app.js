    This is the ecommerce project that I build in a course for learning Complete
    RectJS Ecosystem. Exactly in this course I learned all about React, Redux,
    Routing, Firebase, Stripe, Styled Components, deploment, patterns, sagas,
    hooks, stripe, Apollo + GrapgQL, performance, PWA, security, testing,
    webpack + babel, gatsby more.... by senior developers. This is also the time
    where I got some amazing knowledge of how to do best performace improvements
    and accessbility.
